# Wakatobi fisheries landings data cleaning and analysis for Humphries Lab

# To-do’s:
# -	*Get raw data sheets (unmerged) or work with Melati to get fish and trip data to merge appropriately to recoup missing observations
# -	Spellcheck Bajau names (KG)
#    o	Bajau fish key translations for Bajau fish names to scientific 
# -	Translate engine types
#    o	Create list of unique types of engines (PC)
# -	Convert trip time in days to hour units (KG: DONE)
# -	Convert box/baskets to kg/weight (LJ)
# -	Convert fish flow units to weight and then percentage (LJ)

# Questions for Melati:
# -	Is the second ‘season’ column (with p’s and t’s) indicating moon phase?
# -	*Treating gear-type combos (e.g. double-net-spear) as distinct gear-types, ask Melati to clarify what each is in case some should be merged
# -	Units dimensions of gear?
# -	Clarify gear effort (time, reps, no.)
# -	How do the fish flow options relate to where (what destination, on island, off island) fish are going?

# Questions for Austin:
# -	Ask Austin if he wants the crew portion (amount of catch or revenue going to each crew member) data and if yes talk to Melati about this data
